## Used Technologies

## Additional Technologies

**Database:** Msyql for store both the messages received and sent. For now, the database needs to created manually. We're using send_email_test for tests, send_email_development for development and send_email for production. The data into send_email_test will be deleted after the tests. The seed.rb it is responsible the initial load in both development and production environment.

**Tests:** The tests are defined as use case of the Junit. The tests of rest services have: Spring Web MVC for mock of the web infrastructure; JsonPath e hamcrest are used for access and assertions in the Json content. The tests have been made available in the structure: src/test/java.
